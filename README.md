- I really enjoyed putting my HTML and CSS knowledge into a single page, applying the "mobile-first" concept. It was definitely something that I thought would not work for me but definitely starting with the creation of a mobile-first page allowed me to realize the mistakes I was making when I wanted to make my pages responsive.

- I understood and was able to put into practice the user experience for both mobile and desktop or large screens.


Challenge: Create a static page with HTML and CSS following the designs. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

<ul>
   <li>User story: I can see a page following the given design</li>
   <li>User story: I can see a page on mobile following the given design</li>
   <li>User story: I can go to certain locations by selecting links in navigation or footer</li>
</ul>


<i>Includes mobile navigation</i>
